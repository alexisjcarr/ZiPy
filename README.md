# Implementing a Zero‑Inflated Poisson Regression Package in Python

## Background
Some count data, at times, may prove difficult to run standard statistical analyses on, because of a prevalence zeros that may skew the dataset. Zero‐inflated Poisson regression solves this problem by allowing for the presence of greater variability within a dataset than would be expected based on a given statistical model. This model assumes that a sample is a mixture of two individual sorts — one of whose counts are generated through standard Poisson regression. The other group can be termed as absolute zero, where there exists zero probability of a count greater than 0. Observed values of 0 could come from either group. This model is most suitable for applications when a conventional negative binomial model might not be a good fit. Its application ranges from software fault prediction to the evaluation of prognostic factors of disease.

This model is easily implemented in R via the `pscl` package. However, there is currently not a Python implementation of a similar package. Our project seeks to translate the zero‐inflated model functionality of the `pscl` package into Python.

## Objectives
For this project, we aim to accomplish the following goals. Goals I and II constitute our minimum viable product, while we aim to complete Goal III if time permits.

● Goal I. Translate the R `pscl` package function zeroinf, namely the sub‐functions listed below. Said sub‐functions will use the results of `GLM.fit` for their starting values. We will limit ourselves to implementing the `logit` link for simplicity.
○ likelihood and log‐likelihood
○ gradient likelihood 
○ maximum likelihood

● Goal II. Compare the functionality of our package for both veracity and speed against the R pscl package.
○ The veracity of the results will be tested on the datasets supplied with the `pscl` package, including but not limited to the absentee ballot dataset.
○ The speed will be clocked using the linux command‐line tool `time` tool to time both the R and Python packages real runtimes.

● Goal III. Implement at least one of the following:
○ zero‐inflated negative binomial regression
○ zero‐inflated geometric regression
